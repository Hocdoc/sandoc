/** API for creating directives, the extension mechanism of reStructuredText.
 *  The API did not aim to mimic the API of the original Python reference implementation.
 *  Instead the goal was to create an API that is idiomatic Scala, fully typesafe and as concise as possible.
 *  Yet it should be flexible enough to semantically support the options of the Python directives, so that
 *  ideally most existing Python directives could theoretically get ported to Laika.
 * 
 *  Entry points are the `BlockDirective` and `SpanDirective` objects. The Python reference parser does
 *  not make this distinction on the API level, but does this internally based on the context a 
 *  directive is parsed in. Since Laika APIs are typesafe, the distinction is necessary since
 *  block level and span level directives create different types of document tree nodes.
 *  A `SpanDirective` can only be used in a substitution definition which can then be used
 *  within flow elements. A `BlockDirective` can be used directly in any location other block
 *  level content like paragraphs or lists can be used.
 * 
 *  A directive may consist of any combination of arguments, fields and body elements:
 * 
 *  {{{
 *  .. myDirective:: arg1 arg2
 *   :field1: value1
 *   :field2: value2
 * 
 *   This is the body of the directive. It may consist of any standard or custom
 *   block-level and inline markup.
 *  }}}
 * 
 *  In the example above `arg1` and `arg2` are arguments, `field1` and `field2` are fields,
 *  and followed by body elements after a blank line. If there are no arguments or fields
 *  the blank line may be omitted. For the full specification, see 
 *  [[http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html#directives]].
 * 
 *  For each of these directive elements, the API offers a method to specify whether the
 *  element is required or optional, and an optional function to convert or validate the
 *  parsed value.
 * 
 *  Consider the following simple example of a directive with just one argument and
 *  a body:
 * 
 *  {{{
 *  .. note:: This is the title
 *  
 *   This is the body of the note.
 *  }}}
 * 
 *  The implementation of this directive could look like this:
 * 
 *  {{{
 *  case class Note (title: String, 
 *                   content: Seq[Block], 
 *                   options: Options = NoOpt) extends Block 
 *                                             with BlockContainer[Note]
 *
 *  val rst = ReStructuredText withBlockDirectives
 *    BlockDirective("note") {
 *      (argument(withWS = true) ~ blockContent)(Note(_,_))
 *    }                                        
 *
 *  Transform from rst to HTML fromFile "hello.rst" toFile "hello.html"
 *  }}}
 * 
 *  The `argument()` method specifies a required argument of type `String` (since no conversion
 *  function was supplied). We need to set the `withWS` flag to true as an argument cannot have
 *  whitespace per default. The `blockContent` method specifies standard block content (any block-level
 *  elements that are supported in normal blocks, too) which results in a parsed value of type
 *  `Seq[Block]`. Finally you need to provide a function that accepts the results of the specified
 *  directive elements as parameters (of the corresponding type). Here we created a case class
 *  with a matching signature so can pass it directly as the target function. For a block directive
 *  the final result has to be of type `Block` which the `Note` class satisfies. Finally the directive 
 *  gets registered with the `ReStructuredText` parser.
 * 
 *  If any conversion or validation is required on the individual parts of the directive they can
 *  be passed to the corresponding function:
 * 
 *  {{{
 *  def nonNegativeInt (value: String) =
 *    try {
 *      val num = value.toInt
 *      Either.cond(num >= 0, num, "not a positive int: " + num)
 *    }
 *    catch {
 *      case e: NumberFormatException => Left("not a number: " + value)
 *    }
 * 
 *  case class Message (severity: Int, 
 *                      content: Seq[Block], 
 *                      options: Options = NoOpt) extends Block 
 *                                                with BlockContainer[Message]
 * 
 *  val rst = ReStructuredText withBlockDirectives (
 *    BlockDirective("message") {
 *      (argument(nonNegativeInt) ~ blockContent)(Message(_,_))
 *    }
 *  )    
 *  }}}
 * 
 *  The function has to provide an `Either[String, T]` as a result. A `Left` result will be interpreted
 *  as an error by the parser with the string being used as the message and an instance of `InvalidBlock`
 *  containing the validator message and the raw source of the directive will be inserted into the document
 *  tree. In this case the final function (`Message`) will never be invoked. A `Right` result will be
 *  used as an argument to the final function. Note how the case class now expects an `Int` as the first
 *  parameter.
 * 
 *  Finally arguments and fields can also be optional. In case they are missing, the directive is still
 *  considered valid and `None` will be passed to your function:
 * 
 *  {{{
 *  case class Message (severity: Option[Int], 
 *                      content: Seq[Block], 
 *                      options: Options = NoOpt) extends Block 
 *                                                with BlockContainer[Message]
 * 
 *  val rst = ReStructuredText withBlockDirectives (
 *    BlockDirective("message") {
 *      (optArgument(nonNegativeInt) ~ blockContent)(Message(_,_))
 *    }
 *  )    
 *  }}}
 * 
 *  The argument may be missing, but if it is present it has to pass the specified validator.
 * 
 *  In case of multiple arguments, the order you specify them is also the order in which they
 *  are parsed from the directive markup, with the only exception being that required arguments
 *  will always be parsed before optional ones, and arguments with whitespace need to come last.
