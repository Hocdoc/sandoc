Customizing Renderers
=====================

In some cases you might want to override the output of a renderer for a few types
of document tree nodes only, while keeping the default for the rest. Both the
Transform and Render APIs offer a hook to easily do that without modifying
or extending the existing renderer. 

This is the signature of a custom renderer hook:

    W => PartialFunction[Element,Unit]
    
`W` is a generic type representing the writer API which is different for each 
output format. For HTML it is `HTMLWriter`, for PrettyPrint it is `TextWriter`,
a superclass of `HTMLWriter`. This way renderers can offer the most convenient
API for a specific output format.

Creating a function that expects a writer instance and returns the actual custom
render function in form of a partial function allows to 'capture' the writer
in a concise way like the examples below will show.
    


Using the Transform API
-----------------------

In the following example only the HTML output for emphasized text will be modified,
adding a specific style class:

    val open = """<em class="big">"""
    val close = "</em>"

    Transform from Markdown to HTML rendering { out => 
      { case Emphasized(content, _) => out << open << content << close } 
    } fromFile "hello.md" toFile "hello.html"
    
For HTML `out` is of type `HTMLWriter` and `<<` is one of the methods to append text.

For all node types where the partial function is not defined, the default renderer
will be used.

Multiple custom renderers can be specified, they will be tried in the order you added
them, falling back to the default in case none is defined for a specific node.

The `content` value above is of type `Seq[Span]`. `<<` and other methods of the
`HTMLWriter` API are overloaded and accept `String`, `Element` or `Seq[Element]` 
as a parameter, with `Element` being the abstract base type of all tree nodes.
This way rendering child elements can be delegated to other renderers, either another
custom renderer or the default. In almost all cases, a custom renderer should not render
the children of a node passed to the function itself.


Using the Render API
--------------------

The principles are the same as described for the Transform API above, in case you
skipped the previous section. 

The syntax is very similar, applying the same renderer as in the example above
with the Render API looks like this:

    val doc: Document = ...
    
    val open = """<em class="big">"""
    val close = "</em>"
    
    Render as HTML using { out => 
      { case Emphasized(content, _) => out << open << content << close } 
    } from doc toString
    
    
The Writer APIs
---------------

In the examples above we only needed the basic `<<` method. This secion provides
an overview over the full API.

Btw: in case you do not fancy operators as method names, the writer APIs are the only ones
in Laika making use of them. It turned out to improve readability for most common
scenarios where you have to chain lots of elements, often including indentation
and newline characters for making the output prettier. There are not that many,
so it should be easy to memorize them.

Writers differ from all other Laika objects in that they are stateful. But the
only state they keep internally is the current level of indentation for prettier
output which greatly simplifies the use of the API for rendering elements
recursively. A new writer instance is created for each render operation,
so there is no need to share it between threads.  


### TextWriter

This is the base API supported by both the `PrettyPrint` and `HTML` renderer,
while the latter adds a few additional methods specific to HTML.

All methods below are overloaded and accept `String`, `Element` or `Seq[Element]` 
as a parameter, with `Element` being the abstract base type of all tree nodes.
When passing Elements to the writer it will delegate to the renderers responsible
for those nodes.

* `<<` appends to the output on the current line.

* `<<|` appends to the output on a new line, with the current level of indentation

* `<<|>` appends to the output on a new line, increasing indentation one level to the right

When using the last method with Element instances which might themselves delegate
rendering of their children, you get a nicely formatted output without much effort.


### HTMLWriter

This writer supports all methods of the `TextWriter` API shown above, and adds
the following methods:

* For the three methods above, there is a variant that replaces special HTML
  characters with HTML entities and should be used for writing text nodes. They
  are named `<<&`, `<<|&` and `<<|>&` and otherwise behave the same as their
  counterparts without the `&`.
  
* The `<<<&` method does not have a counterpart without `&`. Like the others
  it replaces special HTML characters, but it writes without any indentation,
  no matter which level of indentation the writer currently has,
  which is needed for writing nodes like `<pre>` where indentation would be
  significant. 
  
* The `<<@` method is a convenient way to write an HTML attribute. It is overloaded
  and either takes `(String, String)` or `(String, Option[String])` as parameters
  for name and value of the attribute. If the value is None, nothing will be written,
  but it often makes writing optional attributes more concise.
